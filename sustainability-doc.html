<h2>How does ZAGA Sustainability solution works</h2><br>
  <p>ZAGA Sustainability Solution is based on Kepler.</p>
    <h3>Kepler</h3><br><p>
    Kepler is a Kubernetes-based Efficient Power Level Exporter project, which focuses on reporting, reduction, and regression to help enterprises better understand and manage energy consumption in cloud environments. Its primary purpose is to advance environmentally-conscious efforts in cloud computing. Specifically, Kepler uses eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) to probe energy-related system statistics and exports them as Prometheus metrics. These metrics provide valuable insights into the energy consumption of containerized applications, allowing organizations to optimize resource usage and minimize energy waste.
<br>
    By integrating Kepler into their cloud infrastructure, organizations can benefit from the following sustainability aspects:
    <br>
    1. Energy Consumption Monitoring: Kepler enables the monitoring of energy-related system statistics for containerized applications, providing visibility into their energy consumption patterns.
    <br>
    2. Resource Optimization: By understanding the energy consumption of containerized applications, organizations can optimize resource allocation and usage to reduce energy consumption and minimize waste.
    <br>
    3. Environmental Impact Mitigation: With insights from Kepler's metrics, organizations can implement strategies to mitigate the environmental impact of their cloud-native applications by improving energy efficiency.
    <br>
    4. Open Source Community Collaboration: The Kepler project leverages open source community collaboration and an upstream-first mindset, which fosters innovation and accelerates the development of sustainable cloud computing practices.
    <br>
    5. Integration with Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF): Kepler is part of the CNCF Sandbox, where contributors explore how to integrate Kepler into their own use cases, promoting its adoption and further development within the cloud native ecosystem.
    <br>
    Overall, Kepler plays a crucial role in advancing sustainability in cloud computing by providing the means to measure, analyze, and improve the energy efficiency of containerized applications, ultimately contributing to environmentally-friendly cloud operations.
