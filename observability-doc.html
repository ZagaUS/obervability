Developed by the Apache Software Foundation, Kafka is designed to handle large volumes of data, providing a scalable and fault-tolerant infrastructure for streaming data.
                    <br><br>Key features and concepts of Apache Kafka include:<br><br>
                        <strong>Publish-Subscribe Model:</strong><br>
                        Kafka follows a publish-subscribe model where producers publish messages to topics, and consumers subscribe to those topics to receive the messages.
                        <br>
                        <strong>Topics:</strong><br>
                        Topics are logical channels or categories to which messages are published. Producers write messages to topics, and consumers read messages from topics.
                        <br>
                        <strong>Partitions:</strong><br>

                        <br>
                        <strong>Durability and Replication:</strong> <br>
                        Kafka ensures durability by persisting messages to disk. Data is replicated across multiple brokers to provide fault tolerance. Configurable replication factors determine the number of replicas for each partition.
                        <br>
                        <strong>Streaming and Event Sourcing:</strong><br>
                        Kafka can be used for building real-time streaming applications and event sourcing architectures. It supports processing events as they occur and maintaining an immutable log of events for auditing and analysis.
                        <br>
                        <strong>Connect API:</strong><br>
                        Kafka Connect is an API for connecting Kafka with external systems such as databases, storage systems, or other messaging systems. Connectors enable the integration of Kafka with a variety of data sources and sinks.
                        <br>
                        <strong>Security:</strong><br>
                        Kafka provides security features such as SSL/TLS encryption, authentication, and authorization to protect data and ensure secure communication within the Kafka cluster.
                        <br>
                        <strong>Scalability:</strong><br>
                        Kafka is designed to scale horizontally by adding more brokers to the cluster. This allows it to handle large amounts of data and provide high throughput.
                        <br>
