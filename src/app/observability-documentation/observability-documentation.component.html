    <h2>How ZAGA Observability Solution Works</h2>
    <p>
      Our Observability solution operates using OpenTelemetry, an open-source observability framework. It offers a suite of APIs, libraries, agents, instrumentation, and standards to facilitate observability across various distributed system services and components.
    </p>
  
    <h3>Instrumentation:</h3>
    <div class="feature">
      <h4>Manual Instrumentation:</h4>
      <p>Developers leverage OpenTelemetry libraries to instrument their code, collecting trace information, metrics, and logs within the application's codebase.</p>
    </div>
  
    <div class="feature">
      <h4>Auto Instrumentation:</h4>
      <p>Post-deployment, the application can be effortlessly instrumented.</p>
    </div>
  
    <h3>Tracing:</h3>
    <p>
      OpenTelemetry enables users to trace the flow of requests as they move through diverse services and components. Each trace comprises spans, representing individual units of work or operations within a service and containing information such as start and end times, duration, associated attributes, and context propagation details.
    </p>
  
    <h3>Metrics:</h3>
    <p>
      OpenTelemetry supports the collection of metrics, allowing monitoring and measurement of various aspects of application performance, resource utilization, and custom business metrics. Metrics offer aggregated and time-series data to identify trends and anomalies.
    </p>
  
    <h3>Logging:</h3>
    <p>
      OpenTelemetry streamlines the generation of structured logs that offer additional context during debugging and troubleshooting. These logs capture pertinent information about events, errors, or significant activities within the application.
    </p>
  
    <h3>Exporter:</h3>
    <div class="feature">
      <p>OpenTelemetry supports various exporters to send the collected telemetry data to observability backends, such as tracing and metrics databases. The Observability solution exports the data to Kafka.</p>
    </div>
  
    <h3>Kafka:</h3>
    <div class="feature">
      <p>Kafka serves as the backbone for efficient collection and distribution of telemetry data, enabling seamless data processing and streamlined communication within the Observability infrastructure.</p>
    </div>
  
    <h3>Observability Backend:</h3>
    <div class="feature">
      <p>Our observability backend receives and stores the telemetry data for analysis and visualization. This data is then queried by another Backend application, and the data is viewed using the front-end application.</p>
    </div>
